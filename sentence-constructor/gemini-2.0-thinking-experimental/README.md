Student Input: The boy runs quickly to see his friend

### Response 1

はい、こんにちは！ Hai, konnichiwa! Hello there!  Let's work on translating your sentence "The boy runs quickly to see his friend" into Japanese.

This is a great sentence to start with.  To help you translate it, we should first break it down and learn some key vocabulary.  Here's a table of words that will be helpful:

| English Word | Japanese Word (Dictionary Form) | Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji | Romaji       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| boy          | おとこ(のこ)                    | 男の子                  | otoko(no ko) |
| run          | はしる                          | 走る                    | hashiru      |
| quickly      | はやく                          | 早く                    | hayaku       |
| to see       | あう                            | 会う                    | au           |
| friend       | ともだち                        | 友達                    | tomodachi    |

Remember, these are the dictionary forms of the words.  Japanese often uses different forms depending on the context and grammar.

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. In English, we often put the verb after the subject and before the object. "The boy runs quickly to see his friend."

Japanese sentence structure can be a bit different.  Think about where the verb usually goes in a Japanese sentence.  It's often said that Japanese sentence structure is Subject-Object-Verb.

Consider these points and try to piece together your Japanese sentence.  Think about:

How would you say "boy" in Japanese, based on the vocabulary?
How would you say "friend"? And "his friend"? (Think about possessives - though we can keep it simple for now and just say "friend").
Which word is the verb in the sentence? (runs/to see) And what are their dictionary forms from the table?
Where do verbs usually go in Japanese sentences compared to English sentences?
How about "quickly"? Where do adverbs like "quickly" usually go in relation to verbs?
Take your time, look at the vocabulary, think about the sentence structure hint, and try to translate "The boy runs quickly to see his friend" into Japanese.  Let me know what you come up with!  頑張って! (Ganbatte! - Do your best!)
