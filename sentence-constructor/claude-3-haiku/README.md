Student Input: The boy runs quickly to see his friend

### Response 2

Hai, let's work on translating that sentence into Japanese together.

Vocabulary:
- boy - 男の子 (otoko no ko)
- run - 走る (hashiru)
- quickly - 早く (hayaku)
- to see - 見る (miru)
- friend - 友達 (tomodachi)

Sentence Structure:
In Japanese, the sentence structure is typically Subject - Object - Verb. So the order would be:

男の子 - 友達 - 早く 走る

Now, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The subject is "the boy" which is 男の子 (otoko no ko)

2) The object is "his friend" which is 友達 (tomodachi)

3) The verb is "runs" which is 走る (hashiru)
And the adverb "quickly" is 早く (hayaku)

So putting it all together, your Japanese translation would be:

男の子が 友達を 早く 走る

How does that look? I've provided the vocabulary and sentence structure, but let me know if you need any clarification or have another attempt at translating the full sentence.

## Additional Notes

- First few attempts with prompting resulted in responses that were purely in japanese
- Similar to the other models, I am unable to tell when the model is doing the correct thing that we are looking for as I do not know enough japanese to tell if the model is providing value clues or breaking the rules (in terms of providing tense)
